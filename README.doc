#URLockbox

URLockbox is a small Rails application where an user can create an account and save url’s similar to having a favorites tab but in a secure account.


URLockbox works beautifully on its own but it also works seamlessly with the Rails app [Hot Reads](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/hot_reads). Hot Reads will display the most popular/accessed links from URLockbox users by making API calls.
